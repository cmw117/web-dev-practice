        <h2>Dinosaurs in the Triassic Period</h2>

        <img src="images\triassic.jpg" alt="dinosaurs">
        <p>Dinosaurs first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research.</p>
        <p>The Triassic Period (252-201 million years ago) began after Earth's worst-ever extinction event devastated life. </p>
        <p>The Permian-Triassic extinction event, also known as the Great Dying, took place roughly 252 million years ago and was one of the most significant events in the history of our planet. It represents the divide between the Palaeozoic and the Mesozoic Eras.  </p>
        <h2>Permian-Triassic Extinction: the Great Dying</h2>
        
        <p>The cause of the Permian-Triassic extinction event is not fully understood. Various theories have been proposed, such as an unknown asteroid impact, massive volcanic eruptions in what is now Siberia, the release of methane from the depths of the oceans, sea level change, increasing aridity, or a combination of many of these.</p>
        <p>By some estimations, the Great Dying was responsible for the extinction of up to 90% of all species. It wiped out many groups of insects, large numbers of mammal-like reptiles, and killed off all the trilobites, a group of animals that had existed in the oceans for close to 300 million years. </p>
        <p><em>'What we see when we come through into the Triassic is a re-establishment of ecosystems,' says Paul. 'The first few million years of the Triassic is marked by an absence of coals. This is thought to be related to the mass extinction that happened and the time it took for the recovery of plants.'</em>

            This sequence is known as the coal gap, a period in which there was seemingly no coal being laid down. As coal is formed from plant matter that has decayed into peat, it has been suggested that the absence of coal in the first few millions of years of the Triassic was a direct result of the Permian-Triassic extinction event, as plants slowly became re-established in the landscape.
            
            By some estimates, it may have taken up to 10 million years for the planet to recover from the devastation caused by the Great Dying.</p>
        <h2>The Supercontinent Pangea</h2>
        <p>The Triassic is largely defined by extinctions, but it is also characterised by the position of the continents at that time. There was only one giant landmass: Pangea.

            'One might think that because you had this big land mass joined up that the environment across it would be very similar,' says Paul. 'But it's not. There were still quite a lot of differences between the flora in the northern and southern parts.
            
            'Pangea was an extraordinary thing and we haven't seen the like of it since.'
