        <h2>Brief Overview</h2>

        <img src="images\jurassic.jpg" alt="dinosaurs">
        <p>The dinosaurs survived the natural disaster at the end of the Triassic period and went on to dominate the Jurassic period (208 to 146 million years ago). The supercontinent Pangaea which had dominated the Triassic period was rapidly breaking up, and mountains rising up from the ocean floor pushed sea levels up. This made the previously hot and dry climate fairly humid, and prompted the growth of many more plants and trees such as palms and ferns. The dinosaurs in this period were huge, with the Brachiosaurus standing at 85 feet long, 52 feet tall and weighing 80 tons. These massive herbivores were matched with equally large carnivores, such as Allosaurus. The earliest known bird, Archaeopteryx, also originated from the Jurassic period.</p>
        <p>Dinosaurs, birds, and rodents. Crumbling landmasses and inland seas. Sea monsters, sharks, and blood-red plankton. Forests of ferns, cycads, and conifers. Warm, moist, tropical breezes. This was the Jurassic, which took place 199 to 145 million years ago.</p>
        <h2>Pangea Splits</h2>
        <p>Pangea continued to split apart during the Jurassic. This caused volcanoes to erupt along the Tethys Sea floor where the rift between the continents began. </p>
        <p><strong>North American Mountain Building</strong>
            On the ocean side of Pangea, the plates continued to collide. One plate was being forced under another. Folds, uplifts and volcano eruptions occurred along the moving plates. The mountains that stretch from British Columbia, through North America and into South America were beginning to form during this time. </p>
        <p><strong>>Warm Climate Fosters New Species</strong
            The climate was warm and stable. Many types of animals and plants developed. The numbers of different species increased greatly during the Jurassic Period.</p>
        <h2>The Seas Of The Jurassic</h2>
            <p>In the seas, there were more and more invertebrate species. Belemnites and ammonites increased and were the most important of the invertebrates during the Jurassic Period. Gastropods, or sea snails, were a mollusk that grew plentiful in the Jurassic period. Corals began to produce reefs in the warm seas. There were many types of bony fishes, sharks and rays swimming in the tropical seas. </p>
        <p><strong>Predators of The Deep:</strong>
            The seas of the Jurassic Period were filled with predators. The ammonites, belemnites, and fish were all excellent hunters. This may be the reason for some speciesâ€™ numbers growing fewer. There were not as many brachiopods or crinoids as in the previous periods. These animals, that stayed fixed on the sea floor, could not complete with the moving predators for food. </p>
