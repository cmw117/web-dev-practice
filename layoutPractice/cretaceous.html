        <h2>Brief Overview</h2>

        <img src="images\cretaceous.jpg" alt="dinosaurs">
        <p>The Cretaceous period stretched from 146 to 65 million years ago, and by the end of this period, the landmasses were in much the same position as they are today. Throughout the period the continents had been moving further apart; this and the increasing expanses of ocean caused the climate to become more moist and cool. New types of dinosaurs evolved as well. Herds of Iguanadon and Triceratops were widespread and Tyrannosaurus Rex terrorized the northern hemisphere while Spinosaurus dominated in the south. Mammals were becoming more common and more species of birds were competing with the flying reptiles for the skies. But, at the end of this period, the dinosaurs were wiped out by another natural disaster and life on Earth was never quite the same again.</p>
        <p>As such, birds were the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds. This article deals primarily with non-avian dinosaurs.</p>
        
        <h2>People Love Dinosaurs!</h2>
        <p>Since the first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture.</p>
        <p>The large sizes of some dinosaur groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs' regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park.</p>
        <p>Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.</p>
